  "description": "Here you can find a collection of some one-shots I've done in the past. I'm sure there are more out there, but these were what I could find on my computer. Some were started as a way to teach very basic principles and I want to come back to later on (lady red), and others were started and then abandoned because I learned new techniques and didn't want to continue with the arduous task of major corrections (Cinder Queen). \n\nFor all these one-shots, I do hope you find some enjoyment in them, and if you have any questions regarding any of them, please do let me know!\n\nfollow me on Twitter for more updates on any current projects I'm working on. \nhttps://twitter.com/ericmartinDOOD\n\nIf you would like to support my efforts in creating new manga series and other manga-related projects, please feel free to send a tip my way at my ko-fi!\nhttps://ko-fi.com/ericmartindood\n\nIf you would like to be a \"Producer\" and help in funding any manga I'm currently working on, join here!\nhttps://ko-fi.com/ericmartindood/tier",
