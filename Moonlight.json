  "description": "Moonlight is a fun slice-of-life manga about ghoul hunting! The concept for this series was \"What do these two characters do in their spare time outside of work?\" the answer \"ghost hunting\" to make it less on the nose we renamed it Ghoul Hunting. \n\nYou will meet a colorful cast of ladies in this series that will tie into the larger universe that is known as \"Muscle+Mass\", so characters introduced from the other line of stories will make an appearance here from time to time. \n\nGenre: Slice-of-Life, Comedy, Supernatural Thriller\n\nFor more information about this world or the cast of characters feel free to hit me up on twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/ericmartinDOOD\n\nIf you would like to support my efforts in creating this series and others, please feel free to send a tip my way at my ko-fi!\n https://ko-fi.com/ericmartindood ",
